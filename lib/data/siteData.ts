      "Teeth whitening is one of the most popular cosmetic dental procedures, offering a quick and noticeable way to enhance your smile. However, many patients ask: is it safe and effective? The short answer is yes, when done correctly under professional supervision.",
      "Professional teeth whitening treatments use peroxide-based bleaching agents that break down stains into smaller particles, making the color less concentrated and your teeth brighter. Unlike store-bought kits, dentist-supervised whitening is customized to fit your mouth, protecting your gums from irritation.",
      "While minor sensitivity is common immediately after the treatment, it is temporary and resolves within a few days. We recommend consulting with our specialists before any treatment to ensure your teeth are healthy enough for bleaching."

      "Straightening your teeth not only improves your appearance but also enhances function and prevents future dental issues. If you are considering orthodontic treatment, you are likely deciding between traditional braces and clear aligners.",
      "Braces are fixed metal or ceramic brackets connected by wires. They are highly effective for complex movements and do not require patient compliance to stay in place. However, they are visible and require dietary adjustments.",
      "Clear aligners are custom-made plastic trays that are virtually invisible. They can be removed for eating and cleaning, making oral hygiene much easier. However, they must be worn for at least 22 hours a day to be effective.",
      "The best choice depends on your specific dental alignment needs, lifestyle, and preferences. Schedule a consult with Dr. Neha to find the perfect plan for you."
